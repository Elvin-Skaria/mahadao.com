				ARTH is designed to maintain its purchasing power over time,<br>irrespective of which direction the market moves.<br>
				ARTH is able to do this as it is firstly backed by stable collaterals, which are complete hedges of one other, so that if one asset depreciates in buying power, the other in turn appreciates, keeping the net buying power of the coin stable.
